# Learn Automation with GitHub Actions 

### A guide for the bewildered
GitHub Actions learning resources aren't made for non-technical people new to automation. It's too bad because it's an otherwise accessible way to learn about automation. This repo should help with that.

### Pre requisites that might help:
<br>git basics: commit and push
<br>github repositories basics
<br>very basic 1, 2 or 3 line R and bash coding
