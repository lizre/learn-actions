# Learn Automation with GitHub Actions 

# Is this for me?
Actions is a way to make a GitHub computer do things for you, like run some code that makes a file. The steps you make it do are called a "workflow". You can make it do your workflow on a schedule, or when certain events happen (like someone pushes to your repo).

### Why use actions: what you can do 
[Lint](https://github.com/r-lib/actions/blob/master/examples/lint-project.yaml) your code when you push it
<br>[Save data](https://blog.simonpcouch.com/blog/r-github-actions-commit/) at regular intervals
<br>[send messages](https://github.com/orchid00/actions_sandbox/blob/master/.github/workflows/greetings.yml) in response to issues or pull requests 
<br>[Render](https://github.com/orchid00/actions_sandbox/blob/main/.github/workflows/deploy_bookdown.yml) and deploy, e.g., rmarkdown
<br>[Big list](https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples) of other things useful for R

But GitHub Actions learning resources aren't made for non-technical people new to automation. It's too bad because it's an otherwise accessible way to learn about automation. This repo should help with that. 

### Pre requisites that might help:
git basics: commit and push
<br>github repositories basics
<br>very basic 1, 2 or 3 line R and bash coding
