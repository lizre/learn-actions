# Learn Automation with GitHub Actions 

### A guide for the bewildered
GitHub Actions learning resources aren't made for non-technical people new to automation. It's too bad because it's an otherwise accessible way to learn about automation. This repo should help with that.

### Pre requisites that might help:
<br>git basics: commit and push
<br>github repositories basics
<br>very basic 1, 2 or 3 line R and bash coding


### [Basic workflow](https://github.com/lizre/learn-actions/blob/main/learn-actions/learn-actions-basic.md)
### [Debug and troubleshoot](https://github.com/lizre/learn-actions/blob/main/learn-actions/debugging.md)
### [Intermediate workflow](https://github.com/lizre/learn-actions/blob/main/learn-actions/learn-actions-intermediate.md)
